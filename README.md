# Web_Scrapping

I scraped data from nba.com/stats for analysis and learned how to find NBA APIs, and scrape data on a large scale with the Python requests package.

Different libraries like Pandas, numpy and time are used for scrapping and creating a dataset.

After creating dataset, we further moved for data cleaning and data preparation, in which we have used drop methods to drop unwanted columns which are

not useful.

After that following things are done :

1) Player stat correlations
2) Player minutes and scoring distributions (Playoffs vs. Regular Season)
3) How the game has changed over the past decade (Playoffs vs. Regular Season)


How many player stats are correlated is seen via plotly and then player minutes and scoring distrubtion are analysed.

And at last How game has changed over decades is shown. 

And mainly analysis are done for "Regular season vs playoffs".

This is all I have done and learned while scrapping and doing analysis.
